# Mini Ultra Pro
Mini Ultra Pro is an Arduino Compatible 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ board that is suitable for ultra low power applications. During deep sleep mode, the board consumes only 18 uA (with the on-board serial flash chip and radio module in sleep mode). The board comes equipped with a 2Mbyte of serial flash and radio module option (choice of RMF95W (LoRa) or RFM69HCW (FSK)). Suitable application includes ultra low power wireless sensor network nodes that runs on Li-Ion/Pol batteries. On-board charger supports Li-Ion/Pol with proper load sharing capability to prolong the lifespan of the battery. Radio module options depends very much on the desired radio range with the LoRa capable RFM95W radio managed to achieve up to 8 km (in semi urban area, frequency of 915 MHz, transmission power of 20 dBm, LoRa spreading factor (SF) of 12, and coding rate (CR) of 4/5) and FSK RFM69HCW radio. A unique 64-bit MAC ID chip (Microchip's 24AA02E64T) is available on-board to be used as DEVEUI in a LoRaWAN network.
